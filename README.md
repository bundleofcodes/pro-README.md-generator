# Professional README Generator

## Description:

The purpose of this project was to learn how to create a node.js application that utilizes user input form inquirer to generate a Professional README.md file for user repositories. Depending on the series of questions and how the user answers in the commnad line using Node.js, this application will arrange the file according to the answers it receives in the prompts and create a file that can be used by other developers. This application taught me how to install npm and work within the command line to generate this application as well as attaching a license badge link to the application.
 
## Installation:

npm i
Node.js

## Usage:

Installing npm and node.js to run this application
